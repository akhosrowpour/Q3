Project Proposal

Despite all improvements in buildings shell, equipment, and design, CO2 emissions from buildings are increasing. Since occupants spend more than 90% of their time indoors, they are inseparable and significant elements of building system dynamics. Hence, there is a great potential for energy efficiency in buildings using a wide range of programs such as demand-response programs and eco-feedback. The advancement of technology and penetration of smart meters in civil and infrastructure systems have facilitated the analyses required to better understand the potential of energy savings and life cycle cost assessment of such investments. In this project, I'd like to conduct an analysis on various parameters affecting residential, commercial, and industrial sectors' energy consumption and provide a reliable cost-benefit analysis based on the data provided by U.S Energy Information Administration. Furthermore, I am aiming to develop a predictive model that can provide insights regarding the future energy savings potential and the level of investments required to achieve such goal.

In order to prove that such project is worth the time and effort, I have parsed the data and conducted multiple hypothesis tests to determine if there are any significant correlations between deployment of smart meters, enrolment in the demand response programs, and the energy saved as a potential result for each and every sector. Currently, numerous utility companies are putting effort in incorporating such analyses to increase their profit through reduction of peak hour energy loads, while developing robuster prediction models to better estimate the required energy power by the grid. Companies such as Opower Inc. and Pacific Electric and Gas are among the frontrunners of this industry.

For the sake of this project, I  downloaded and parsed an open source electric power sales, revenue, and energy efficiency Form EIA-861 detailed data files published by U.S Energy Information Administration.There are multiple components which I'd like to consider in my project as described below:

1- Conducting a comprehensive life cycle cost analysis for automated metering readers and infrastructure systems (AMR, and AMI) and provide a comprehensive report on the return on investment of such projects.
2- Identifying the underlying root causes of energy savings using various parameters provided in the dataset.
3- Developing a predictive model which can estimate the trajectories of required investments and potential energy savings in the future.
4- analyzing the potential interdependency of climate on the level of savings achieved in each state.
5- Analyzing the resilience and reliability of various energy grids under extreme weather conditions and natural disaster.
6- The aforementioned analyses will be conducted for all three sectors (i.e. residential, commercial, and industrial)

In the sample analysis provided here, merely the electric power sales, revenue, and energy efficiency of year 2014 was used. However, the database goes back to 1990. I am confident that by end of the bootcamp, I will be able to provide a comprehensive data analysis report on the demand management, resiliency, and life cycle cost assessment of residential, commercial, and industrial sector. This report can provide further insight to utility companies and government in further improve the regulations and business models they are incorporating at this stage.
